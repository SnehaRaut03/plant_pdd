"Pepper,_bell___Bacterial_spot",Remove infected plants and apply bactericides like copper-based products. Avoid overhead watering as it can spread the bacteria. Rotate crops to prevent the buildup of bacterial pathogens in the soil.
"Pepper,_bell___healthy","Water bell peppers regularly, especially during flowering. Ensure they receive organic fertilizers and mulch to retain moisture. Check for pests and diseases and remove any affected plants immediately."
Potato___Early_blight,Apply fungicides like chlorothalonil to control early blight. Remove infected leaves and avoid overhead irrigation. Practice crop rotation and ensure good soil drainage to prevent future outbreaks.
Potato___healthy,"Ensure potatoes are planted in well-drained soil with adequate sunlight. Water regularly, especially during dry periods, and apply balanced fertilizers. Mulch around the plants to retain moisture and reduce weed competition."
Potato___Late_blight,Apply fungicides during wet weather to prevent late blight. Remove infected leaves and stems and dispose of them away from the field. Rotate crops and avoid over-watering to reduce the humidity that promotes blight.
Raspberry___healthy,"Raspberries require slightly acidic, well-drained soil and regular watering. Prune dead or damaged canes to encourage healthy new growth. Mulch around the base to retain moisture and prevent weed growth."
Soybean___healthy,"Soybeans need good drainage, proper spacing, and regular watering. Fertilize with nitrogen-rich compounds to support healthy growth. Rotate crops to avoid soil-borne diseases and improve soil fertility."
Squash___Powdery_mildew,Apply sulfur-based fungicides or neem oil to control powdery mildew. Remove infected leaves and ensure proper spacing for air circulation. Avoid overhead irrigation to prevent the spread of fungal spores.
Strawberry___Leaf_scorch,Remove affected leaves and apply copper-based fungicides. Water at the base of the plants and avoid wetting the foliage. Mulch around the plants to retain moisture and prevent weed growth.
